# Dano Airlines Customer Satisfaction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a Capstone challenge where I assumed the role of a Data Analyst for **Dano Airlines**, a UK-based airline headquartered in London.  

The latest passenger survey results showed that the satisfaction rate has dipped **under 50%** for the first time ever. The leadership team needs actionable insights quickly, so the task was to analyze the data, identify key pain points, and recommend a data-driven strategy to increase satisfaction.

The final deliverable is a **single-page interactive dashboard** built in Tableau Public.

### Dataset
- Customer satisfaction scores from **120,000+ airline passengers**.
- Includes passenger details (age, gender, customer type), flight info (distance, delays, class), type of travel (business/personal), and ratings (1-5 scale) for various service factors.
- Source: [Google Sheets Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Kp-2yfQFNRGJPNOkpMwG-OMX8xVZOJ5VL7f35v7sRQ/edit#gid=1647986900)

## Tools Used
- **Tableau Public** (web authoring) – for visualization and dashboard creation
- Excel/Google Sheets – for initial data download

## Key Insights
- **Overall Satisfaction**: **43.4%** (below 50% target)
- **By Customer Segment**:
  - Business travelers: **~72%** satisfied
  - Economy travelers: **~31%** satisfied
  - Leisure (Personal travel): **~10%** satisfied
- **Strongest Services**:
  - Baggage Handling (~73%)
  - In-Flight Service (~73%)
  - Seat Comfort (~69%)
- **Weakest Services** (priority areas):
  - In-flight WiFi (~55%)
  - Food and Drink (~64%)
  - Cleanliness (~66%)

Average ratings across services are higher (~70-78%) than overall satisfaction, indicating that specific pain points are driving dissatisfaction.

## Data-Driven Recommendations
1. **Target Economy & Leisure Travelers** – They form the majority and have the lowest satisfaction. Introduce targeted perks (e.g., free WiFi vouchers, meal upgrades) for personal travel and Economy class.
2. **Prioritize Critical Service Improvements**:
   - Upgrade **In-flight WiFi** (lowest score) – offer free basic access in Economy.
   - Enhance **Food and Drink** options – partner with better caterers or add premium meal choices.
   - Improve **Leg Room** – promote or expand premium Economy seating.
3. **Operational Focus** – Reduce delays (correlate strongly with low scores).
4. **Measure Impact** – Run follow-up surveys after changes and track satisfaction quarterly.

**Expected Outcome**: Focused improvements could lift overall satisfaction back above 50% within 6-12 months.
