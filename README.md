## Tools Used
- **Tableau** – for data analysis and dashboard creation  
- **GitHub** – for project documentation and version control

## Analysis Approach
The analysis focused on answering three core business questions:

1. **What is the current customer satisfaction rate?**  
   - Calculated the percentage of passengers who reported being satisfied to create a **satisfaction rate KPI**.

2. **What factors are driving customer dissatisfaction?**  
   - Analyzed satisfaction against key service quality variables such as seat comfort, cleanliness, and in-flight service to identify low-performing areas.

3. **Which customer segments are most affected?**  
   - Compared satisfaction levels across travel class, type of travel, and customer type to determine which passenger groups require the most attention.

## Key Insights
- Overall customer satisfaction has **fallen below 50%**, signaling a significant performance issue.  
- **Seat comfort** and **in-flight service** are the lowest-rated service factors and show the strongest relationship with dissatisfaction.  
- **Economy-class passengers** exhibit the lowest satisfaction levels, indicating a gap in service quality and comfort expectations.  
- **Business travelers** demonstrate higher sensitivity to service-related factors compared to leisure travelers.  

---

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

- **Prioritize improvements to economy-class seat comfort**, including seating layout and legroom adjustments.  
- **Implement targeted cabin crew training programs** to improve in-flight service quality.  
- **Focus improvement efforts on high-volume passenger segments**, particularly economy-class and business travelers, to maximize impact.
